- While scaffolding the client app, we discovered that the server would require `"type": "commonjs"` in `package.json`, but vite scafolds apps with `"type": "module"`. This will probably not impact the built version of the client app, but it may affect the dev server behavior later.

- Nodemon may be watching the client files as well, which may slow down the development API server
- TODO: configure CORS to be less permissive on the server than "\*"
